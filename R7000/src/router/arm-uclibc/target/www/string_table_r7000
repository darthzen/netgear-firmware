In addition, when you are out of the country, you can use the VPN Service to access the Internet sites or services for which there is a geographic limitation and they are not accessible outside the country. To use the VPN Service, you will need to locate your router through the Internet when you are out of home. There are two ways to do that and the suggested way is to use the Dynamic DNS service. The other way is to locate your router through its public Internet address and it is better to have static IP address settings for the router's Internet  connection. Please make sure you have either the Dynamic DNS service enabled or static IP address settings for your Internet connection.

If you want to access the Internet sites or services with a geographic limitation when you are out of the country, you have to select the option &quot;All sites on the Internet &amp; Home Network&quot;. Please note that once you have selected this option, your VPN client will also access Internet sites and services that do not have a geographic limitation. For an Internet site or service that is normally accessible through the Internet (for example, public networks that do not have a geographic limitation), the access speed through the VPN Service is slower than the access speed without going through the VPN. The &quot;Auto&quot; option will do some intelligence checking and try to use the VPN Service only for necessary accesses (i.e. only for sites or services that are not accessible if not going through the VPN Service), but this is just a best effort function and a correct determination cannot be guaranteed.</p></div></body>"
